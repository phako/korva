# korva - A media push service

Korva is a [D-Bus specification](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Rygel/Korva)
that aims to simplify single file remote media sharing such as DLNA Push.

This source package contains a implementation of the server-side of the
specification as well as a simple command-line client.

The only protocol currently implemented is UPnP, Apple's incarnation of media
sharing might follow.
